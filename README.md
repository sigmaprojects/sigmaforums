===========
Built as a ColdBox module prototype.  May be missing information.  

This is not a finished product, it was thrown together as a proof of concept.

Uses the CB Solitary module for authentication.

Warning: In it's current state it is not compatible with Railo or CB4+.  It relies heavily on the Solitary module which hasn't been updated in 3 years.
